An average person speaks 11000â€“25000 words per day making speech the most common way of expressing ourselves. Be it a conversation, dialogue, speech, presentations or any general talks, we use speech to make other as well as ourselves understand thoughts and actions. If either of the side is unaware of the language of communication, the cycle will be incomplete. Hence we need a system that can bridge this language barrier. Speech to speech translation is one such system that can play important role by facilitating communication between persons speaking different languages. Worldwide efforts are being made to achieve this goal and implement it practically for use by common man.
